## 🌀 Overview

This Universal Protocol System represents a paradigm shift in computing, integrating:
- 369 Vortex Mathematics
- Sacred Geometry
- Quantum Computing Principles
- Toroidal Field Configurations
- Fibonacci Sequence & Golden Ratio
- Resonant Frequency Harmonics

## 🔮 Core Principles

### Vortex Mathematics (369)
The system is built on the fundamental principles of vortex mathematics, utilizing the sacred numbers 3, 6, and 9 as described by Nikola Tesla. These numbers form the basis of our computational architecture.

### Sacred Geometry Integration
- Flower of Life
- Metatron's Cube
- Golden Ratio (φ)
- Fibonacci Sequence

### Quantum Framework
```python
dimensions = 11  # 11D space configuration
frequency_base = 369.0  # Tesla harmonic base
phi = 1.618033988749895  # Golden Ratio
```

## 🌟 Features

### 1. Toroidal Field Generation
- Creates self-sustaining energy fields
- Implements resonant chamber algorithms
- Utilizes sacred geometry patterns

### 2. Quantum Integration
- Quantum state encoding/decoding
- Harmonic frequency alignment
- Vortex transformation protocols

### 3. Sacred Geometry Processors
- Flower of Life pattern generation
- Metatron's Cube implementation
- Golden Ratio spiral calculations

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/universal-protocol.git
cd universal-protocol
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

```python
from universal_protocol import UniversalProtocol
from quantum_protocol_bridge import QuantumProtocolBridge

# Initialize the protocol
protocol = UniversalProtocol(dimensions=11)

# Create quantum bridge
bridge = QuantumProtocolBridge(dimensions=11)

# Process data through the system
result = bridge.process_hybrid_state(input_data)
```
